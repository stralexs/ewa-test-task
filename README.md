Application is written in SwiftUI.      
Animation is added for the spin of prize wheel.     
It has 2 main screens: DebugInterfaceView for incrementing and resetting day count and PrizeWheelView where user can spin the wheel to win one of five prizes. There is no element of chance in the task, because user can only win a certain prize each day of login.     
DataBaseManager class has been added to the application for testing purposes only in order to mock it when testing PrizeWheelViewModel.
